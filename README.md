# Capitdle
A guessing game where one has to try to guess the target American capital based on geographical hints such as cardinal directions and distances. 

üá∫üá∏ How to play:
You will get five guesses to find the target American capital. From your guess, you will get a direction cardinal direction which shows your guess in relation to the target. You will also get the distance in miles from the target. MAKE SURE TO USE CORRECT SPELLING AND CAPITALIZATION.  


‚≠êÔ∏è Algorithims Used: 
- Recursive loops to import CSV data into game engine. 
- Utilized the "Some great circle formulae" to get the distance between the guessed and target capital. 
- Created an algorithm that takes in the latitude and longitude coordinates of both capitals, then calculates and assigns the proper cardinal direction.
